# Watch Later

An app to track any media you want to want to watch later, be it films, shows, YouTube videos, and potentially more!

This is primarily intended for release as an Android phone application, but other platforms are possible!

## Quick Start

*Consumer & internal use not yet supported*

## Technical Details

The code will be based on [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/), intialized with [Ignite](https://github.com/infinitered/ignite).

Typescript is likely, but I'm not 100% committed just yet!

## Contribution

This project is still *very* young, and I'm not sure if/when I'll accept contributions.

But you have any ideas or suggestions, I'm always open! You're welcome to make tickets in the GitHub or reach out directly at dustin.seger@hotmail.com, and I'll do my best to track these areas for new info.

Thanks for your interest!

\- Dustin
